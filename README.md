# Overview

This file provides a [sample of the code](code/model.R) used in Zhang et al. (Nat Commun 14, 6867 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-42530-w). This code is intended for transparency and reproducibility and is not able to run.

This project uses dataset that involves daily and county-level information on mortality from a spectrum of causes, sand and dust storms (SDS) event exposure, air pollution and meteorological exposure during 2013 and 2018 in 214 Chinese counties.

This project also include processed [data](data/data1.csv) for the 6 variables of interest used in our stage1 models for the primary analysis.
